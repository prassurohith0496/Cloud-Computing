 -----------------------------

 - Several different models, types, and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.

 - There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.

 

 Public Cloud:

 .............

 Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources, 

 like servers and storage, over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all 

 hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these 

 services and manage your account using a web browser.

 

 Private Cloud:

 ...............

 A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. 

 A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party 

 service providers to host their private cloud. private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are 

 maintained on a private network

 

 Hybrid Cloud:

 .............

 Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. 

 By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, 

 more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

 

 

4.Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and Saas:

-------------------------------------------------------------



Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):

....................................

The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), 

storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.



Platform as a service (PaaS):

..............................

Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, 

and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without 

worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.





Serverless computing:

......................

Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers 

and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless 

architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.



Software as a service (SaaS):

..............................

Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. 

With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software 

upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.





5.Uses of cloud computing:

--------------------------

- You’re probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realize it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, 

  watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games, or store pictures and other files.



. Create cloud-native applications

. Store, back up, and recover data

. Test and build applications

. Stream audio and video

. Deliver software on demand.
