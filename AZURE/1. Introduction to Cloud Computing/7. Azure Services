Azure Services:
=================
- Availability of services across Azure regions depends on a region's type. There are two types of regions in Azure: recommended and alternate.
  Recommended: These regions provide the broadest range of service capabilities and currently support availability zones. 
               Designated in the Azure portal as Recommended.
  Alternate: These regions extend Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region currently exists.
