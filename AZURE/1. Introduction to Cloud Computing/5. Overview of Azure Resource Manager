Azure Resource Manager:
=======================
1.Overview:
------------
- Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create,
  update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and 
  organize your resources after deployment.
  
2.Consistent management layer:
-------------------------------
- When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. 
  It authenticates and authorizes the request. Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service, which takes the requested action. 
  Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.
  
 Note: All capabilities that are available in the portal are also available through PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST APIs, and client SDKs.

3.Terminology:
---------------
. resource - A manageable item that is available through Azure. Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks 
  are examples of resources. Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags are also examples of resources.
  
. resource group - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to
  manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.
 
. resource provider - A service that supplies Azure resources. For example, a common resource provider is Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the 
  virtual machine resource. Microsoft.Storage is another common resource provider.
