Overview of Azure Networking:
===============================

1.IP ADDRESS:
-------------
- IANA is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority that manages and assigns the IP address in the world.
- IP Address identifies each device on a network uniquely.
- There are currently two IP Adress that is IPv4 and IPv6. 
  An IPv4 address contains a total of 32 binary bits divided into 4 equal octets (8-bit block), 
  whereas IPv6 is written in hexadecimal notation, separated into 8 groups of 16 bits by the colons, thus (8 x 16 = 128) bits in total.

IV4:
----
- We will focus on IPv4 as it is the most used. 
  Each octet of an IP Address is separated by a decimal and ranges from 0 to 255. 
  You will clearly understand the binary number, octets, and IP address formation in the below table.
  
There are two different IP address one is private, and the other is public.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Private IP is accessed only within a network like a simple school network with a LAN connection.
2. Public IP is accessed globally via the Internet.


2.What is IP Subnetting?
-------------------------
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into many smaller networks.
- There are 5 classes of IP address and each with a unique purpose.
- Only the first octet is used for dividing an IP Address into different classes

Table of Classes:
-----------------
Class A      0.0.0.0      -  126.255.255.255
Class B      128.0.0.0    -  191.255.255.255
Class C      192.0.0.0    -  223.255.255.255
Class D      224.0.0.0    -  239.255.255.255
Class E      240.0.0.0    -  255.255.255.255

- Class D is reserved for multitasking and broadcasting purpose, whereas Class E is reserved for research and development. 
  So both these classes are reserved and can not be used. The below table shows the range of the first octet in an IP address with each class.

Note: The IP address with the first octet as 127 (in decimal) is a loopback address to check the network and address of the machine itself.

- An IP address can further be divided into small networks depending on the use and purpose. 
  The above classes are not sufficient for real-life use. Only 5 classes can not hold all the hosts on the same network, 
  and the loss of IP address will be huge. So, the CIDR method was introduced
