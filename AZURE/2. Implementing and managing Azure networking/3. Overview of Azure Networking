Azure Networking:
=================
1.IP Address in Azure:
-----------------------
- The two different types of IP Address used and allocated in Azure are Public IP and Private IP.

Private – The Private IP address allows communication of resources within the azure resource group. 
          In other words, resources can not access a private IP outside the network. The resources 
          that can be connected using a private address are VM Network Interface, ILB (Internal Load Balancer) and Application Gateway.
          
Public – The Public IP address allows Azure Resources to communicate with public-facing Azure services via the Internet. 
         In other words, resources can access public IP outside the network. Some resources that can be connected using 
         public address are VM Network Interface, Public Facing ILB, Application Gateway, VPN Gateway and Azure Firewall.

2.IP Allocation:
-----------------
Dynamic IP – The default allocation method by which Azure can automatically assign the available and unreserved IP address from the subnet’s address range. 
             Also, the Dynamic IP is not fixed and changes with time.
             
Static IP – This is the custom allocation method to assign the available and unreserved IP address from the subnet’s address range. 
            The Static IP is fixed and does not vary with time.

3.Azure Virtual Networking:
----------------------------
- Azure Network is the interlinking and communication of all the Azure Resources in an organization.
- Virtual Networking is the communication between devices, servers, virtual machines over the internet.
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a private network with interconnected Azure Resources like Azure Virtual Machines, Infrastructure and Network.
- It enables communication between various Azure Resources via the Internet. In a Virtual Network, a continuous block of IP Address is used to 
  create multiple subnet networks.

4.Azure Subnet:
---------------
- As we know, the subnet is a part of a network that covers a range of IP Address. 
  In Azure, VNet can be divided into smaller subnets for organizations. 
  When a VNet is created in Azure, the subnet range and topology needs to be specified. 
  In Subnet, the IP Address range will be a subpart from a big block of IP Address used 
  in Virtual Network (VNet). The Virtual Machines and resources in a network will be assigned 
  the IP Address from these subnets.
  
 
 5.Azure Network Interface:
 ----------------------------
 - In Azure, NIC is virtual ethernet cards that help communicate the Virtual Machines present in a network. 
    When a Virtual Machine is created in Azure, the NIC with default settings is automatically created. 
    Also, Network Interface settings in Azure can be customized using command tools like Azure CLI and PowerShell.
    
    
 6.Network Security:
 ---------------------
- Azure provides various protection methods for securing a service in a network. I have listed down some of the basic 
  network security tools with a short description.

7.Network Security Group (NSG):
--------------------------------
- The Network Security Group in Azure acts like a firewall at the network level. 
- It filters the traffic passing through Azure Resources in a virtual network. 
- NSG is a group of security rules that defines the priority, source or destination, 
-  protocol, direction, port range and action. Using these rules, NSG allows or deny inbound and outbound traffic. 
- The rules for entering traffic inside a resource is also called ‘Ingress‘, and the rules for exiting the traffic or 
  going out of the resource is called ‘Egress‘. When all the rules are created, the NSG can be used in a Virtual Machine 
  that will interact with a network.
