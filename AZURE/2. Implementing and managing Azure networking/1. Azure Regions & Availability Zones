Azure Regions & Availability Zones:
===================================
- Azure regions and availability zones are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.
- Azure maintains multiple geographies. 
- These discrete demarcations define disaster recovery and data residency boundaries across one or multiple Azure regions. 
- Maintaining many regions ensures customers are supported across the world.

1.Regions:
-----------
- Each Azure region features datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter. 
  They're connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. 
  This design ensures that Azure services within any region offer the best possible performance and security.
  
2.Availability zones:
---------------------
- Azure availability zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures.
- Failures can range from software and hardware failures to events such as earthquakes, floods, and fires. 
- Tolerance to failures is achieved because of redundancy and logical isolation of Azure services.
- To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions.

- Azure availability zones are connected by a high-performance network with a round-trip latency of less than 2ms. 
- They help your data stay synchronized and accessible when things go wrong
- Each zone is composed of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
- Availability zones are designed so that if one zone is affected, regional services, capacity, and high availability are supported 
  by the remaining two zones.
- Each data center is assigned to a physical zone. Physical zones are mapped to logical zones in your Azure subscription. 
  Azure subscriptions are automatically assigned this mapping at the time a subscription is created.
